# SMTP Mailer with SMTP Server

This repository contains an executable SMTP Mailer that simplifies sending emails using an SMTP server. The mailer reads SMTP configuration from a text file and sends HTML-formatted emails using the provided credentials. Watch the [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOklI4FHRdk) for a quick guide on how to use the mailer.

## Usage
1. Prepare an HTML email template.

2. Create smtp.txt with server details: 

- server:port:user:pass

3. Prepare emails.txt with recipient email addresses

4. Double-click SMTP Mailer v1.3.exe to run. The mailer will prompt you for:

- the mail From (Name).
- the Subject of the email.
- the recipient list file (txt).
- the HTML email template file (html).
- the SMTP configuration file (txt).

The mailer will then process the provided information and send the emails to the recipients using the configured SMTP server.

Feel free to customize the script. If you encounter issues or have suggestions, open an issue or PR.
